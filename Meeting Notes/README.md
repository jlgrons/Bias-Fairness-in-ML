# Meeting Notes

## 08/16/22

* Papers to review:
  * start with the [calibration overview](https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/27/4/621/5762806) from last time; this is the style of paper we are going for
  * search JAMIA website to see what exists there on fairness
  * [bias in real life](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aax2342)
  * [early fairness paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12002.pdf)
  * [overview paper](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-statistics-042720-125902)
  * [overview paper](https://fairware.cs.umass.edu/papers/Verma.pdf)
  * [overview paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-07939-1) - See references therein
* A comparative analysis of the various metrics can be found in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07864.pdf)


## 09/15/22
* Papers read: Calibration tutorial paper and "Dissecting racial bias in an algorithm used to manage the health of populations", in the process of reading "Why Is My Classifier Discriminatory?"
* For next week: "Why Is My Classifier Discriminatory?" and "Algorithmic Fairness: Choices, Assumptions, and Definitions"

## 09/28/22
* Updates: Created overleaf document to store notes for literature review. 
* Papers read: "Why Is My Classifier Discriminatory", "Algorithmic Fairness: Choices, Assumptions and Definitions", "Fairness Definitions Explained", in the process of reading "A Clarification of the Nuances in the Fairness Metrics Landscape"
* Next week: Finishing up "A Clarification of the Nuances in the Fairness Metrics Landscape", "Fairness Metrics: A Comparative Analysis" and looking into their references/searching what else is on JAMIA. 
* Questions:
 - What application will we be using for the tutorial paper? How do we select which metrics of bias and fairness we want to discuss in the paper?
